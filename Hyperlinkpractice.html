<h1> HYPERLINKS</h1>
<div id="absolute">
	<h3>Absolute References</h3>
<p>
	Absolute references(sometime called as external link) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag
	the full url of the page , image , or other resource you would like to link to is specified . One example might be your quest 
	to list some of the greatest bakeries of all the time Since you want to link to the bakeries themselves and not files you wrote, you would use a absolute reference. 
</p>
 <ul>
 	<li> <a href="http://www.cksbakery.com/"> CK's Bakery</a> </li>
 	<li> <a href="http://www.newapurva.com/"> newapurva.com </a> </li>
 	<li> <a href="http://londonbakery.in/"> London Bakery.com</a> </li>
 </ul>

<p class="advantage">
	An advantage of absolute references is that you are always linked to the most up-to-date information 
	on that page. A disadvantage is that it is up to you to make sure that the link's does't change. 
</p>

</div>

<div id="relative">

<h3> Relative References </h3>
<p>
	Relative reference (sometime also called internal links) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attributes of the tag 
	only the folder (if any) and filename is specified. Some examples of when you might use relative references would be in you navigation bar or links to your images. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>  <a href="donut.jpg"> Donut from london bakery </a></li>
</ul>





<div id="images">
<h3> Images As links</h3>
  <p>More and more peoples are moving away from textual prompts to ones that are graphics based. This is because the page looks "nicer" . I can redo the link above using a picture instead of words.</p>
<!--
  <a href="http://www.londonbakery.in"> 
  	<img src="donut.jpg" alt = "Picture of donut" >
  </a> -->
</div>
<img src="Images/sony.jpg" alt="sony with aalia" >
 

  <h3> Embedded Links</h3>
  <p>
  	Every tag can have an id attribute . The id attribute gives a name to a specific section of the <abbr title="Document object model"> DOM </abbr>.<hr> You can use that id to 
  	link directly to a part of a page instead of just a page in general. This is a great way to allow people to quickly jump 
  	from one part of your page to the specific section you looking for . Review the material on:
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li> <a href="#absolute">  Absolute reference </a> </li>
  	<li> <a href="#relative">Relative reference </a> </li>
  	<li> <a href="#images">Images as links </a> </li>
  	<li> Embedded reference</li>

  	<p>
  		When you click on any of the above links , the browser will bring that section into focus . It may be the case that the bottom two links don't do anything for you. that is because this content is already in your screen.
